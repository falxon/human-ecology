For a long time I viewed humans (myself included) as a cyst on our environment and so making the mistake of viewing humans as totally separate from it. I think this mistake is what leads to a lot of our destruction of nature and so through this project I hope to bring us closer to nature and in doing so perhaps together we can help save our planet and the nature within.";

Growing up, I loved nature and annoyed my parents endlessly trying to convince me to keep various pets and telling them every detail of something new I’d learnt about our environment or the little critters that lived within it. I even began to introduce small moths to keep me company in my room, not realising that it’d lead to my clothes and my parents’ carpet being ravaged!";
